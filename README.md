## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with Swift syntaxâ€”most of my time spent on this project was spent on looking up documentation on things like passing closures, calling functions correctly, and expecially syntax for passing arguments into functions. There were also some syntax rules I was unfamiliar with, such as putting a . before certain arguments. For example, cell.set(style: .initial). Hopefully, I won't be spending as much time struggling to figure it out moving forward.
